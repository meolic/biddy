----------------------------------------------------------
Biddy is based on BDD package written in Pascal in 1992.
That BDD package was later rewritten in C and become an
integral part of EST package, a prototype tool for formal
verification of concurrent systems.

In June 2007, BDD package in EST has been renamed to become
Biddy v0.9. Afterwards, it was completely reorganized and
Biddy v0.99 was built as a standalone module. Biddy v1.0a
was the first one, which was also distributed separately
from EST.

Biddy is used by:
- Bdd Scout (http://biddy.meolic.com/)
- EST 1st Edition (http://est.meolic.com/)
- EST 2nd Edition (http://est.meolic.com/)
----------------------------------------------------------

Biddy v0.9, was integrated into EST 1st Edition v1.4
released on Jun 13, 2007 and EST 2nd Edition v4.5 released
on Jun 11, 2007.
